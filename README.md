// Tweet from the Clouds //

## Introduction
Our application uses the Twitter API and the WordsAPI as well as the wordcloud2.js library to make a visually appealing data analysis of a User's word selection in their Tweets. We select either the last 10, 15 or 20 Tweets of a User and return their most frequently used words in a word cloud. A User is then able to select words, getting a list of definitions as well as a list of synonyms for these words. If a User chooses to log in, they also have the ability to save a word to their WordBank, being able to call upon the words at a later time. This application was designed with social media managing in mind. Unique word choice in social media posts is extremely important for user engagement.
